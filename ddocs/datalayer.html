The main data access component in FrontDesk is the IFrontDeskDataProvider
interface. Such an interface allows for implementing classes to use
database engine specific techniques in order to make implementation as
efficient as possible, while maintaing the flexibility of supporting
multiple engines.

<br><br>

<pre>
public interface IFrontDeskDataProvider {

     public bool ValidateUser(String user, String password);
     public UserCollection GetGroup(String groupname);
     public UserCollection GetLateSubmitters(int assignment);

     // And more!
     ...

}
</pre>

<br>

In order to make this useful, we implement the interface.

<pre>
//SQL Server FrontDeskDataProvider implementation
public class SqlFrontDeskDataProvider : IFrontDeskDataProvider {

    public bool ValidateUser(String user, String password) {
        // Invoke SQL Server stored procedure
    }

}

//Generic SQL engine FrontDeskDataProvider implementation
public class GenericFrontDeskDataProvider : IFrontDeskDataProvider {

    public bool ValidateUser(String user, String password) {
    
        //Roll through a bunch of SQL to validate
    }
}
</pre>
<br>

All data elements will be represented as "components". For instance, a User
component could look like:

<pre>
public class User : IComponent {

    public String UserName;
    public int type;

    //And more!
}
</pre>

<br>

A key point about this is that there is no database code in this
component. The responsibility of converting a database record into a User
component object is the role of the data provider, not the component
itself.<br><br>

The particular technique described here entails that a program wishing to
use these components know nothing about where the data comes from. It need
not even be stored in a database, it could be in XML files or some other
medium. All that is needed for the FrontDesk application as a whole is an
implementation of the functionality in IFrontDeskDataProvider in order to
be able to access those interface functions to manipulate a backing store
it doesn't care about.<br><br>

<b>Advantages</b>: 
<ul>
<li>Provides a data source independent medium for FrontDesk to manipulate
data</li>
<li>Retains SQL engine flexibility while maintaining performance</li>
<li>Pluggable support through reflection and configuration</li>
</ul>

<b>Disadvantages</b>:
<ul>
<li>FrontDesk data interaction limited by what is provided in
IFrontDeskDataProvider</li>
<li>Someone needs to create these providers</li>
</ul>
