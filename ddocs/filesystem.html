<br>

The main revelation for the FrontDesk file system is the notion of storing
all data in the main database. Access to files is done through the
IFrontDeskDataProvider layer and <b>not</b> through the underlying OS file
system. <br><br>

<b>Reasons:</b>
<ul>
<li>By using the file system you are also using the OS, would rather
not.</li>
<li>Using the database effectively make the file system available to any
client that can connect to the database. This includes clients on different
computers, particulary <b>Testing Centers</b>.
<li>Database transactions can help with shared file editing</li>
</ul>
<br>

There are two tables in the database used to implements the file
system. The <b>Files</b> table which contains all the files (and
directories) given by their
name, modification date, creation date, parent directories, and actual
data. Directory structure is given in the <b>Directories</b> table which
contains mappings from dirrectory IDs to file IDs effectively encoding a
UNIX style "inode table" in the database.<br><br>

The question then becomes, how does one access files?
<pre>
public interface IFrontDeskDataProvider {

    public File[] ListDirectory(File directory);
    public File GetDirectory(String path);
    public StringBuffer GetFileData(File file);

    //And more!
}
</pre>
<br>

All file access goes through the IFrontDeskDataProvider module. This
abstracts away the fact that FrontDesk is using a database for storing and
retrieving files. FrontDesk has no idea what is going on when it calls for
ListDirectory for instance, it is all taken care of behind the scenes in a
FrontDesk data provider implementation. For example:

<pre>
public class SqlFrontDeskDataProvider : IFrontDeskDataProvider {

    public File[] ListDirectory(File directory) {
	//Invoke SQL stored procedure to obtain directory listing
    }
}
</pre>
<br>

Here we can be very efficient about getting a directory listing by simply
invoking an SQL server stored procedure. Our generic SQL engine data
provider can do the same thing, just slightly less efficiently.
<br><br>

<b>Advantages:</b>
<ul>
<li>All file data in one place</li>
<li>Available to Testing Center's in a very seamless fashion</li>
<li>Abstracted away by the data provider data layer</li>
<li>Transactions can help in locking issues with editing</li>
</ul>

<b>Disadvantages:</b>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency could become a concern</li>
<li>Somewhat awkward problem of not being able to manually edit files</li>
</ul>
