<b>Testing Interface</b>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to ascertain exact status of grading job</li>
<li>Unable to correct submissions that were handed in improperly and hence cannot be auto-tested by handin.</li>
<li>Confusing parameters to create job page. Common questions include, What is the reference? Do I need to select a comparator?</li>
<li>Performance on larger tests</li>
</ul>

<b>Testing Setup</b>
<ul>
<li>Limited flexibility in testing, do more than just string comparison</li>
<li>Sometimes returns 0 for matching output</li>
<li>Ease of use for testing setup</li>
</ul>
<b>Grading/Execution Interface</b>
<ul>
<li>Extracting Results</li>
<ul>
<li>Unable to view the entire section in a summarized view. </li>
<li>In order to print results of entire section, one needs to print each student in the section one at a time. Would like to just hit print and get all student results on separate pages.</li>
<li>Spreadsheet export for Excel grading managements.</li>
</ul>
<li>Unable to edit student code in any way. It would be nice if one could make marks in the student code for style/correctness issues and have them show up in the printout</li>
<li>Ability to modify objective score, and the addition of a subjective and extra points block for each assignment.</li>
</ul>

<b>Student Interface</b>
<ul>
<li>Unclear if submission went through. Most of the time compile is disabled and pretests don't exist. Would be nice if email was sent or some sort of secondary confirmation existed.</li>
<li>More detail from a compile error. Listing the errors is not useful if you think the program compiles. It would be nice to give a snapshot of the directory struture, current path, and then the compiler erros in order to reveal to the student possible directory structure.</li>
<li>Manage user submission directory. In case of small error, it would nice to fix on handin side. File management is ad hoc.</li>
<li>Performance lags during busy handin times (deadline).</li>
</ul>
