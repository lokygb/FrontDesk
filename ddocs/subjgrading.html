<br>

<b>Problem:</b> Subjective grading currently involves printing out large
code documents and writing in manually comments about the programs
subjective quality. This is clearly a waste of paper and time. Furthermore,
TAs rarely provide any sort of structure to these comments; i.e. there is
no hierarchy of concerns to be addressed and easily referenced by students;
it is all ad hoc.<br><br>

<b>Solution:</b> Provide a means through FrontDesk to create a
hierarchicial representation of subjective grading criteria along with FML
tags to annotate the code itself. This allows general comments to be made
in terms of the criteria and comments to be inserted in a structured way,
all the while maintaining a Web view and reducing time and paper. <br><br>

In order to solve this problem, we associate every <b>Assignment</b> with
an XML file describing the hierarchy of subjective criteria. When the TA
starts the subjective grading page, they are presented with a tree view of
this document and text boxes to fill in how the student submission fulfils
these criteria. Here is an example document:<br>

<pre>

&#60;criteria>
    &#60;Modularity>
        &#60;add desc="Broke down algorithms into component functions" points=10 />
	&#60;add desc="Designed an effective class hierachy" points=10/>
    &#60;/Modularity>

    &#60;Comments>
        &#60;add desc="Judicious use of comments" points=5 />
    &#60;/Comments>
&#60;/criteria>
	
</pre>

Such a document can be both designed and viewed through a tree view control
on the Web page. In other words, a TA does not need to know about XML in
order to create this hierarchy, all XML is take care of through the tree
view provided by FrontDesk.<br><br>

Once presented with this tree view, a TA will then proceed to fill in
comments and points associated with each component of the criteria. Such
comments and points are stored in the <b>Results</b> table in the
database. How is it stored? Using XML again. Example:

<pre>
public class TreeView : IWebControl {

    public void AssociateDataWithNode(TreeNode c, String data) {
        //Associate the String data (TA comment) with a TreeNode
    }

    public XMLDocument ToXML() {
       //Create a new XML document of the criteria will user comments
    }
}
</pre>

The resultant XML document will look like this:

<pre>
&#60;criteria>
    &#60;Modularity>
        &#60;add desc="Broke down algorithms into component functions"
	points=10 assigned=6 comment="Too much code in main!" />
	&#60;add desc="Designed an effective class hierachy" points=10
	assigned=10 comment="Great job!"/>
    &#60;/Modularity>

    &#60;Comments>
        &#60;add desc="Judicious use of comments" points=5 assigned=0
        comment="No comments!" />
    &#60;/Comments>
&#60;/criteria>
&#60;/pre>

This document will be stored in the <b>Results</b> database table and will
of course be access through the proverbial IFrontDeskDataProvider.<br>

<pre>
public interface IFrontDeskDataProvider {

    public XMLDocument GetSubjectiveResult(Submission s);

}
</pre>

Alongside FrontDesk FML markup for structured in code comments, this
provides an effective means for a Web centered subjective feedback system
not necessarily limited to programming assignments.
